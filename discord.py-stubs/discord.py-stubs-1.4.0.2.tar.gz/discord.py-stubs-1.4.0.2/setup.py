See the [import discovery](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#import-discovery) section of the `mypy` documentation for more details.\n\n## Development\n\nMake sure you have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.\n\n```\npoetry install\npoetry run pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type post-checkout\n```\n\n\n## Version numbering scheme\n\nAt this time, the version number of `discord.py-stubs` will follow the version number of `discord.py` it corresponds to and append one more version segment that indicates the sequence of releases for the stubs. For instance, if you are using `discord.py` version `1.3.4`, you would use `discord.py-stubs` version `1.3.4.X` where `X` is an integer.\n',
